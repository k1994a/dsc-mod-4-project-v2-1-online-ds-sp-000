# Module 4 Final Project

This project consisted of creating a classifier model (Convolutional Neural Networks) that can classify whether a chest X-ray has pneumonia or is a normal X-ray.

-[Jupyter Notebook](student_final.ipynb): A walkthrough on the iterative process behind evaluating and selecting a final model.

-[Blog Post](https://kahmadi94.medium.com/solidifying-my-knowledge-of-convolutional-neural-networks-576fa9e9730b): A blog post that discusses the concept behind convolutional neural networks in hopes to solidfy my knowledge.

-[Presentation](presentation.pdf): A non-technical presentation that outlines the insights gained from creating a classifier that can provide a pneumonia diagnosis based on a chest X-ray.

-[Video Walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wqd3nMuP9Vlt3TYGOdV2CsXCnWzayZHC/view?usp=sharing): A video that walksthrough the presentation of the insights gained from this work.
